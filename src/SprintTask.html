        <p> <strong>Khabib: Conor McGregor Is 'Finished,' Would Lose to Poirier 100 Out of 100 Times</strong>
            <br> <br>
            Khabib Nurmagomedov didn't mince words when assessing what would happen if Conor McGregor fought Dustin Poirier again following the latter's victory at Saturday's UFC 264.
            <br> <br>
            "What is gonna happen?" he said during a discussion with Brett Okamoto of ESPN. "I don't think something's gonna happen. The judges gave Dustin Poirier a 10-8. He mauled [McGregor] in [the first] round. If they fight 100 times, Dustin is gonna beat him 100 times."
